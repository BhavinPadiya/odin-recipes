The filling often includes mashed potatoes, chickpeas, and finely chopped onions, while the pani is crafted from fresh mint and coriander leaves, tamarind, and a blend of spices that create a refreshing burst of flavors. This delightful snack is not only popular for its taste but also for the fun experience of eating it in one bite, allowing the flavors to explode in your mouth.</p>
